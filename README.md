# Evaluating Early Physiotherapy Impact on Heart Surgery Recovery

This repository contains the final reports and analysis for the evaluation of an early physiotherapy programme for heart surgery recovery. The project was conducted as part of the **MATH11188 Statistical Research Skills** course.


## Project Description

The Scottish government is considering funding an early physiotherapy programme to reduce recovery time after heart surgery. To aid in the decision-making process, this project evaluates the effectiveness of the programme based on data collected from two representative hospitals. The analysis focuses on the length of hospital stay (recovery duration) as a measure of the programme's impact.

## Objective

- **Task 1**: A scientific group report analyzing the effect of early physiotherapy on heart surgery recovery duration.
- **Task 2**: An individual non-technical executive summary that communicates the key findings for decision-makers.

## Files

- The group report which provides a scientific analysis of the early physiotherapy programme's effectiveness in reducing the length of hospital stay after heart surgery.
- The R Markdown file contains the statistical modeling and analysis conducted as part of the evaluation. It includes the methods and code used to analyze the data.
- The individual executive summary that provides a non-technical summary of the findings, aimed at informing decision-makers within the Scottish Parliament.
